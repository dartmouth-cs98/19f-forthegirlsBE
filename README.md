# For the Girls

We are building a mentorship platform for women in tech to connect and develop mentor/mentee relationships

## Architecture

Our backend uses Express as our server framework and and MongoDB to store our data. We're going to have 4 basic data models: users, preferences, events, and messages. 
Procfile set up to run on [heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs#deploy-the-app)

## Setup

First, `brew install mongodb` if you don't have it installed already.
Then, run `yarn install` to get your node modules up to date, and `yarn dev` to start the server.

## Deployment

We will have deployment set up through heroku.
